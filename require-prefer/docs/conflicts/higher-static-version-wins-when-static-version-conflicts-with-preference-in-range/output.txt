Tasks: dependencyInsight --dependency acacia

Scenario: higher static version wins when static version conflicts with preference in range
Preferred version(s): 1.5, null


> Task :dependencyInsight
tree:acacia:2.9
   variant "compile" [
      org.gradle.status             = release (not requested)
      org.gradle.usage              = java-api
      org.gradle.component.category = library (not requested)
   ]
   Selection reasons:
      - By conflict resolution : between versions 1.5 and 2.9

tree:acacia:2.9
\--- project :coast-redwood
     \--- compileClasspath

tree:acacia:{require [1.2, 2.0); prefer 1.5} -> 2.9
\--- project :blue-palo-verde
     \--- compileClasspath
